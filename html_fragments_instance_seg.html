Please draw a segmentation mask over each individual egg in the image. Eggs are typically dark, oblong, and have antennae; however, sometimes they may also be lighter and more irregularly shaped (see examples under &quot;Instructions&quot;).

 
<span style="color: #0ba133"><h2>Good example</h2></span> Each egg is labelled to its outer edge, excluding antennae. Individual eggs are accurately labelled even in the dense regions.

<br> Sometimes the eggs are dimmer, such as the one at the bottom of this image, but they should still be counted.

<span style="color: #a11a0b"><h2>Bad example</h2></span> In this example, the labelling problems are as follows: 
<ol> 
 <li>Some eggs are not labelled.</li> 
 <li>Large dark regions are labelled even though they are not eggs.</li> 
 <li>Some labels span multiple eggs.</li> 
 <li>Labels do not align well with the borders of the eggs, and have irregular shapes instead of the expected oval.</li> 
</ol>
