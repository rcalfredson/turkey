        Please draw a segmentation mask over each individual egg in the image. Eggs are typically
        dark, oblong, and have antennae; however, sometimes they may also be lighter and more irregularly
        shaped.<br><br>
        <h5>How to identify eggs</h5><span style="color: #0ba133"><strong>Good example</strong><br>
        </span> Each egg is labelled to its outer edge, excluding antennae. Individual eggs are accurately labelled even
        in
        the dense regions.<br>

        Sometimes the eggs are dimmer, such as the one at the bottom of this image, but they should still be
        counted.<br>

            style="color: #a11a0b"><strong>Bad example</strong><br></span>
        In this example, the labeling problems are as follows:<ol>
            <li>Some eggs are not labelled.</li>
            <li>Large dark regions are labelled even though they are not eggs.</li>
            <li>Some labels span multiple eggs.</li>
            <li>Labels do not align well with the borders of the eggs, and have irregular shapes instead of the expected
                oval.
            </li>

        <h5>How to use the tool</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Left click</strong> to annotate the image using the brush tool when in annotation mode and to
